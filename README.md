# Badd Neighbor UI

First and foremost credit for this mod goes to steam user Don Camillo for making the original WBUI mod and sharing his source files to others.

How this mod differs from the original WBUI mod:
- The background images were all removed from the mod to reduce the mod size
- 15 images of solid colors were added in place of the background images
- This mod's download size is 0.5 MB compared to the original mods 38.5 MB
- This mod's loading size is 16.7 MB compared to the original mods 42.2 MB
- The mod's asset files were all renamed
- The default and unedited UI has a few changes to include a link back to this page

How this mod is similar to the original WBUI mod:
- Other than the changes above everything else functions and operates just like the original mod
- All configurations and settings are done exactly like the original mod except for the background images
- All functionality of the original mod is intact

What happens when i remove this mod from my game:
- Removing this mod should not adversely affect anything related to your world, player, creatures or save game.

When I can learn to figure it out I want to:
- Change the GUS.ini entry to reflect this mods title and not the original mods title

When I can get around to it I want to:
- Incorporate a setup howto so users do not have to reference from a different location
